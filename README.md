⚡ AI-Based Intelligent FRA Diagnostic System
🚀 Overview

The AI-Based Intelligent Diagnostic System for Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is an advanced platform designed to automate the analysis of transformer FRA data using machine learning, anomaly detection, and expert system logic.

This system eliminates the dependency on manual interpretation by experts and provides accurate, consistent, and real-time fault diagnosis with a professional interactive dashboard.

🎯 Problem Statement

Frequency Response Analysis (FRA) is widely used to detect internal faults in power transformers such as:
